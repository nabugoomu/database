pandas==1.5.2
openpyxl==3.0.8

These two libraries provide the necessary functionality for data manipulation, table creation, and Excel file interaction:

    pandas: Pandas is a powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides efficient data structures and tools for working with tabular data, including dataframes, series, and indices.

    openpyxl: Openpyxl is a library for reading and writing Excel 2010 XLSX/XLSM/XLT/XLTM files. It allows you to create, access, and modify spreadsheets, cells, formulas, charts, styles, and other Excel objects.

With these libraries, your application can handle data input, perform calculations, and store the results in a structured format, both in memory and in Excel files.

Yes, that's correct. The requirements.txt file you just reviewed specifies the Python libraries that are essential for building the application you described. Pandas and Openpyxl are the core libraries that will enable your application to perform calculations and store data in table form.

Pandas will provide efficient data manipulation capabilities, allowing you to organize, filter, and analyze the data you input into your application. It will enable you to perform calculations on the data, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Openpyxl will provide access to Excel file functionality, allowing you to read, write, and modify Excel spreadsheets. This means your application can store the data it processes in a structured format within Excel files, preserving the tabular format and enabling easy sharing and collaboration.

With these libraries, you can build an application that effectively handles data manipulation, calculations, and data storage, mimicking the functionality of MS Excel while adding the flexibility and automation capabilities of Python programming.
